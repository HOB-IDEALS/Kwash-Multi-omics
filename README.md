# Kwash-Multi-omics
This is a repository for analysis codes used in the multi-omic analysis of the Kwashiorkor study. This study analyses:
  - Plasma Lipidomics
  - Plasma Metabolomics
  - Plasma Proteomics
  - Urine Metabolomics

Each of these omic layers has a dedicated markdown file with R codes for the analysis conducted. For each Omic layer, we performed univariate analysis and factor analysis. The univariate analysis encompassed the use of every individual feature (lipid, protein, and metabolite), while factor analysis entailed the construction of latent variables. Therefore, in each Omic folder, there are 3 folders: `Univariate analysis`, `Factor analysis` and `Formal analysis`. The `Univariate analysis` folder contains codes for univariate analysis, the `Factor analysis` analysis folder has codes for latent variable construction while the `Formal analysis` folder has codes for statistical analysis i.e., conditional regression. For more details about the statistical analyses performed please see the article DOI:
